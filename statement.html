<p>Hello my name is Masao Kajiyama. I am majoring in art because I like to draw,paint, and making videos of my own. As an artist, I care about the aesthetic and quality aspects of my videos. When it
    comes to making video, I like to have it be based on my own hobbies. Most of my video I do involves series of my own footage or found footage mashed together.I'm always exploring into different methods and techniques in improving my videos. If I get stuck on a certain game, I would watch a walkthrough or how to
    video.The kind of video I would like to do is an time lapse of me building something or drawing an picture. My vision of installation would be having a room with multiple screen in different places displaying an time lapse video of an busy street or city view. In that room I would want my viewer to be engaged and interested toward
    the footage.</p>
  <p>The approach I take towards my project reflects my interest in bringing multiple footage playing at same time. In exploring my ideas, I look at other artist work and their installation method.
    I was very interested in this one artist where he projected an face toward an object. Having my final project video being in an exhibition gallery
    was an pleasing experience to see. I was very satisfied how smoothly the video played on a laptop where everyone can see my dedication I put into it. I believe
    I did a better job with my final project compared to project 2 we did for this class. Hopefully my video editing skill will improve upon in building more aesthetic looking for my youtube channel after i'm finished with Art 74.</p>
