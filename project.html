<h3>Passion, 2018</h3>
<p>This is a time lapse video of me building a plastic model kit. It is an long tedious process to snap the pieces together as well as gluing and smoothing out individual parts. I decided to Switch the footage audio with a fitting music. I titled this video passion because It's something that I like to do on my spare time other than drawing </p>

  <h3>tribute to Levan Polka, 2018</h3>
  <p>I used videos of dancing anime fictional character from youtube and my own footage of a video game I recorded using my DSLR camera. I used premiere for editing and combining my own footage with found footage. The song I used is called Levan Polka in tribute to Miku which fits with the the footage. The purpose of this video is to have the viewer get the feeling of being in a stress free space.</p>

<h3>world of internet, 2018</h3>
  <p> For my net art project, I created an website where internet have all sort of fun entertainment from gifs to wierd humurous youtube videos. I mostly go on the internet in search for funny memes or watching funny videos on youtube. I made the overall look of the site like the inside of an network server. I went with naming my header label database in relation to my net art title.</p>

  <h3>Nothing but Pixel, 2018</h3>
  <p>This is an pixelated music video using two different footage. Further the video goes, it gets more pixelated and distorted. The song I used for this music video is titled pixel land by Kevin McLeod. I wanted the flow of the video to blend in with the song.</p>
