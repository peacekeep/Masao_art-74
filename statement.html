  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>Hello my name is Masao Kajiyama, <em>student at San Jose state </em>. I am majoring in art because I like to draw,paint, and making videos of my own. As an artist,I care about the effort and quality put into my works. I also care about the audience when working on a project. When it
    comes to making video, I like to have it be based on my own hobbies. Most of my video work I do involves series of gameplay footage or building process of a model kit.I'm always exploring into different methods and techniques in improving my videos. If I get stuck on a certain game, I would watch a walkthrough or how to
    video.Another kind of video I watch is time lapse of building something or someone drawing an picture. My vision of installation would be having a room with multiple screen in different places displaying an time lapse video of an busy street or city view. In that room I would want my viewer to be engaged and interestedt toward 
    the footage. ex.</p>
