  <p>Hello my name is Masao Kajiyama. I am majoring in art because I like to draw,paint, and making videos of my own. As an artist,I care about the aesthetic and quality aspects of my videos. When it
    comes to making video, I like to have it be based on my own hobbies. Most of my video I do involves series of my own footage or found footage mashed together.I'm always exploring into different methods and techniques in improving my videos. If I get stuck on a certain game, I would watch a walkthrough or how to
    video.The kind of video I would like to do is an time lapse of me building something or drawing an picture. My vision of installation would be having a room with multiple screen in different places displaying an time lapse video of an busy street or city view. In that room I would want my viewer to be engaged and interested toward
    the footage.</p>
  <p>The approach I take towards my project reflects my interest in bringing multiple footage playing at same time. In exploring my ideas, I look at other artist work and their installation method.
    I was very interested in this one artist where he projected an face toward an object. I was very pleased to see my project 2 video projected on an big screen where everyone can see my dedication I put into it. I believe
    i did a better job with my project 2 and building of my net art compared to my first project we did. Hopefully my video editing skill will improve upon
