  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>Hello my name is Masao Kajiyama, <em>student at San Jose state </em>. I am majoring in art because I like to draw,paint, and making videos of my own. As an artist,I care about the effort and quality put into my works. I also care about the audience when working on a project. When it
    comes to making video, I like to have it be based on my own hobbies. Most of my video work I do involves series of my own footage or found footage mashed together.I'm always exploring into different methods and techniques in improving my videos. If I get stuck on a certain game, I would watch a walkthrough or how to
    video.The kind of video I would like to do is an time lapse of me building something or drawing an picture. My vision of installation would be having a room with multiple screen in different places displaying an time lapse video of an busy street or city view. In that room I would want my viewer to be engaged and interested toward
    the footage.</p>
  <p>The approach I take towards my project reflects my interest in bringing multiple footage playing at same time. In exploring my ideas, I look at other artist work and their installation method.
    I was very interested in this one artist where he projected an face toward an object. I was very pleased to see my project 2 video projected on an big screen where everyone can see my dedication I put into it. I believe
    i did a better job with my project 2 and building of my net art compared to my first project we did. Hopefully my video editing skill will improve upon
    in building more aesthetic looking for my youtube channel after i'm finished with Art 74.
